        <h2>What is Our Web Extension?</h2>
        <p>There is a need for Tagalog context-based profanity detection and censorship programs for Tagalog text content. The proponents attempted to create a web extension using a fine-tuned Tagalog BERT model trained via the manually scraped and annotated Tagalog Twitter Profanity Dataset (TTP). The proposed web extension will give Twitter users a convenient tool to censor contextually-abusive Tagalog profane words within displayed Tagalog text content</p>

            <li>Feedback/Report feature to keep track of misclassifications and system performance</li>
